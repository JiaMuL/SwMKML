Self-weighted multi-kernel multi-label learning for potential miRNA-disease associations prediction

Method Description:
We proposed a novel Self-weighted multi-kernel multi-label learning method for potential miRNA-disease associations prediction. We used multi-views, including several gaussian matrix calculated by gaussian kernel function and the miRNA functional similarity matrix as well as the disease semantic similarity matrix based on the latest version of MeSH descriptors and HMDD. We adopted a iterative and alternative optimization algorithm, and solved each of the variables separately by fixing other variables. Finally, the predicted miRNA-disease associations matrix was obtained by combining the miRNA space and disease space together.

Method Requirements:
Our method was running in MATLAB, so we required users to install MATLAB version on their operating systems.
